# singer-lab-simulations

A repo to hold all the simulated experiments, and useful functions of the singer lab.

This project will be built as an R package. It is intended for use by the singer lab to run insilico simulations of their experiments. The main goals are:

- Improve resource utilisation (e.g. less animals)
- Improve experimental planning
- Pre-prepare statistical plan before experimentation
- Idea generation
